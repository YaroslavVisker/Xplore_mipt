Purpose: Standardized clinical vocabularies, mappings, and controlled terminologies.

Expected contents:
- ICD-10, SNOMED, LOINC, ATC code subsets relevant to your protocols
- Mappings between different vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED → ICD-10)
- Local custom code sets (e.g., in-house laboratory code mappings)

JSON/YAML files representing:

- value sets
- terminology groups
- enumerations used in DSL rules
