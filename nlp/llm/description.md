Purpose: Code for using LLMs to extract or infer features.

Expected contents:
- Prompt templates for feature extraction
- Prompt chaining logic
- Model connectors (OpenAI, local LLMs, etc.)
- LLM-based "weak supervision" for partially structured data
- LLM-assisted summarization of clinical documents
- LLM-based clinical concept linking
- LLM modules operate on raw inputs to produce structured feature candidates.
