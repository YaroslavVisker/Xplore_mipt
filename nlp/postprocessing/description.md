Purpose: Cleanup, normalization, and correction of extracted features.

Expected contents:
- Units normalization (mg/dL → mmol/L)
- Outlier detection and correction
- Feature smoothing
- Validation and type coercion
- Combining multiple extracted signals into a single feature
- Consistency checks with schemas

This ensures the extracted data is ready for the scoring engine.
